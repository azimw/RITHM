# Getting Started
> This markdown file needs to be updated so that others can get started using RITHM. There is an open [issue](https://github.com/CRMTH/RITHM/issues/12) related to this. For formatting, don't use these quote blocks (they are just here as placeholders). Use heading formats, numbered lists, and links as much as possible (check your markdown cheat sheet or [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)).
